# Springboard_Intro_to_DS
This repository contains all projects, exercises, and assignments as part of Springboard's Introduction to Data Science course. Each folder is its own project coded in R.

- [Basic_Data_Manipulation](https://github.com/curtishiga/Springboard_Intro_to_DS/tree/master/Basic_Data_Manipulation)
  - This project demonstrates the ability to manipulate and clean data in R.
- [CHIS](https://github.com/curtishiga/Springboard_Intro_to_DS/tree/master/CHIS)
  - Demonstrates the ability to do some exploratory data analysis and create plots using ggplot2 in R.
- [Capstone_Project](https://github.com/curtishiga/Springboard_Intro_to_DS/tree/master/Capstone_Project)
  - For my final/capstone project, I looked into how three-point shot metrics affect the performance of a team. Performance was measured on a game-by-game basis and over the course of an entire season.
- [Clustering](https://github.com/curtishiga/Springboard_Intro_to_DS/tree/master/Clustering)
  - This project looks to classify wines using a Kmeans method in R.
- [Handling_Missing_Values](https://github.com/curtishiga/Springboard_Intro_to_DS/tree/master/Handling_Missing_Values)
  - Using the titanic data set, this project utilizes R to handle the missing values.
- [Linear_Regression](https://github.com/curtishiga/Springboard_Intro_to_DS/tree/master/Linear_Regression)
  - This project demonstrates the ability to fit a linear regression model to a data set in R.
- [Logistic_Regression](https://github.com/curtishiga/Springboard_Intro_to_DS/tree/master/Logistic_Regression)
  - This project demonstrates the ability to fit a logistic regression model to a data set in R.
